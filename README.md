# HelloVHDL
 Learning VHDL for my college course

 VHDL stands for `VHSIC Hardware Description Language`, in which, VHSIC is `Very High Speed Integrated Circuit`
 Therefore, VHDL is `Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language`.

 This Language is use to control hardwares. I will keep updating the repo as I learn!
